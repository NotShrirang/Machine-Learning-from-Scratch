# Machine Learning And Deep Learning Algorithms from Scratch

In this repository, major machine learning and deep learning algorithms are implemented from scratch. From scratch meaning without using external machine learning libraries. All of the below mentioned algorithms are implemented in Python, Linear Regression is also implemented in C++. The API structure is similar to the Scikit-Learn library and Tensorflow Keras API.

## Deep Learning:
<a href="https://github.com/NotShrirang/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/tree/main/Neural%20Networks">Neural Networks</a> added with ReLU, Softmax Activations and Categorical Cross Entropy losses.

To use this implementation:

```
pip install open-nn-python
```

# Neural Networks

The forward pass of neural network is implemented by using NumPy only. <br>

The Rectified Linear Activation function (ReLU), and Softmax Activation functions are added.<br>

Catogorical Cross Entropy Loss function is implemented to calculate the loss of network after one pass.<br>

You can run <code>neural_networks.py</code> file to see the demonstration.

Backward pass, optimization is a work in progress...

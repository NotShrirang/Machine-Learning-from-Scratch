# Neural Networks

The neural network is implemented by using NumPy only. <br>

### Includes:
1. The Rectified Linear Activation function (ReLU)
2. Softmax Activation functions are added.<br>
3. Catogorical Cross Entropy Loss function is implemented to calculate the loss of network after one pass.<br>

You can run <code>neural_networks.py</code> file to see the demonstration.

# Neural Networks

Basic neural network implementation by using NumPy only. <br>

Main Repository : https://github.com/NotShrirang/OpenNN <br>
And PyPI Package : https://pypi.org/project/open-nn-python/

## Installing pydbops with PyPI :

```sh
pip install open-nn-python
```

### Includes:
1. The Rectified Linear Activation function (ReLU)
2. Softmax Activation functions are added.<br>
3. Catogorical Cross Entropy Loss function is implemented to calculate the loss of network after one pass.<br>

You can run <code>neural_networks.py</code> file to see the demonstration.
